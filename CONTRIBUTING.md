## Architecture and Development Guides

Before making changes, please familiarize yourself with our architecture and development guides:

1. **[Services Architecture](docs/services-architecture.md)**: Understand the service-oriented architecture of the project
2. **[Extending Services](docs/extending-services.md)**: Guide for adding new stacks or features
3. **[Rule Organization](docs/rule_organization.md)**: How rules are organized and structured
4. **[Performance Guide](docs/performance-guide.md)**: Performance optimization recommendations
5. **[CLI Documentation](docs/cli.md)**: Details about the CLI implementation
6. **[MCP Tools Integration Guide](docs/mcp-tools-guide.md)**: Comprehensive guide for MCP tools development and usage

## Service Development

When developing new services or features:

1. **Follow the existing patterns** in similar services
2. **Use asynchronous operations** for file handling and other I/O
3. **Implement batch processing** for better memory management
4. **Create appropriate tests** for all new functionality
5. **Document service methods** with JSDoc comments

## Rule Development

When creating new rules:

1. Follow the structure outlined in the [Documentation Guide](docs/documentation-guide.md)
2. Place rules in the appropriate directories based on their scope and application
3. Update `kit-config.json` to register new rules
4. Test the rules with the CLI to ensure proper generation

## MCP Tools Development

Agent Rules Kit v2.0+ includes comprehensive support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. When contributing MCP tools:

### Adding New MCP Tools

1. **Create template directory structure**:

    ```
    templates/mcp-tools/your-tool/
    ├── tool-usage.md          # Usage rules and guidelines
    ├── best-practices.md      # Best practices specific to the tool
    └── examples.md            # Common usage examples
    ```

2. **Register the tool in kit-config.json**:

    ```json
    "mcp_tools": {
      "your-tool": {
        "name": "Your Tool - Description",
        "description": "Detailed description of what the tool does"
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Follow MCP documentation standards**:
    - Include available tool functions
    - Provide usage examples
    - Document security considerations
    - Add common workflow patterns

### MCP Tool Documentation Guidelines

Each MCP tool should include:

-   **Basic Instructions**: How to initialize and use the tool
-   **Available Functions**: Complete list of tool functions with parameters
-   **Security Guidelines**: Access controls and safety considerations
-   **Common Patterns**: Typical workflows and usage examples
-   **Error Handling**: How to handle common error scenarios

### Testing MCP Tools

Test your MCP tool rules using the CLI:

```bash
# Test MCP tools generation
pnpm run start
# Select "Yes" for MCP tools
# Choose your tool from the list
# Verify generated rules in .cursor/rules/rules-kit/mcp-tools/
```

### MCP Service Development

When extending the McpService class:

1. **Add new methods** following the existing patterns
2. **Implement proper error handling** with meaningful messages
3. **Use batch processing** for better performance
4. **Add comprehensive tests** in `tests/cli/services/mcp-service.test.js`

## Pull Request Process

2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Include tests for your changes
4. Make sure all tests pass
5. The PR will be reviewed by maintainers
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
